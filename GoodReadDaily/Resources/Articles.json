Researchers analyzed oxygen molecules within 4-billion-year-old zircon crystals from Western Australia’s Jack Hills, one of the oldest rock formations on Earth. The relative proportions of oxygen’s heaviest and lightest forms, or isotopes, in the zircons are possible only if there had been a significant amount of freshwater present, geochemist Hamed Gamaleldien of Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, and colleagues report June 3 in Nature Geoscience. The finding suggests that freshwater may have been actively cycling on Earth hundreds of millions of years earlier than previously thought. Past studies have found evidence that a robust water cycle, one that involved rain and evaporation from the land back to the atmosphere and then rain again, existed by at least 3.2 billion years ago. The presence of freshwater has implications for Earth’s habitability 4 billion years ago. It doesn’t necessarily mean life was present, Gamaleldien says, “but at least we have the main ingredient to form life.” Currently, the oldest agreed-upon evidence for life on Earth comes from fossilized microbial mats in Australia’s Strelley Pool Chert that date to 3.4 billion years ago. Cycles of evaporation and rain alter the chemical makeup of water molecules. When water evaporates from the ocean’s surface, leaving the salt behind, the lighter form of oxygen, oxygen-16, tends to evaporate faster than the heavier oxygen-18. That lighter water may then rain out over land, and perhaps evaporate again. Over time, the freshwater becomes more concentrated in oxygen-16 compared with the original seawater. When that rainwater percolates through the ground, it can chemically react with bedrock or with magma pockets in the rock, imparting lighter isotopic oxygen values — clues that freshwater was present. The team analyzed oxygen isotopic ratios of over 1,300 zircon crystals ranging in age from 4.2 billion to 3.3 billion years ago. Most of the zircons had relatively heavy oxygen isotopic values, as would be expected from seawater. At around 3.4 billion years ago and 4 billion years ago, the ratios indicated a greater proportion of lighter oxygen. In the 3.4-billion-year-old zircons, the team measured ratios of oxygen-18 to oxygen-16 that were as low as 0.1 per mil — a measurement of the ratio of those isotopes when compared with a standard oxygen isotopic ratio from ocean water. That value is very low compared with the average for rocks at that time, about 5 per mil. The 4-billion-year-old zircons had oxygen isotopic values that were about 2 per mil. The team ran thousands of computer simulations to determine the likelihood of different explanations for the observed ratios. “We concluded that the main water on Earth was oceanic,” Gamaleldien says. “But only when we used freshwater [did] it create the results we see.” Gamaleldien’s team presents a convincing case that there was freshwater cycling on Earth 3.4 billion years ago, but the jury is still out on whether that was the case 4 billion years ago, says geochemist Jesse Reimink of Penn State. “The early Earth is really difficult [to study] because there are so few data points,” Reimink says. Ancient crystals like these remain the only clues scientists have to Earth’s earliest time, he adds. “We need to keep pushing the limits of these zircon grains.”",
